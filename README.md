# __Bikeshare User Data Analytics__

#### Date created
The project was created on December 14th, 2018.
README file was created on December 17th, 2018.

### Project Description
This is a tool to explore and analyze bikeshare data from [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com) (data from January to June of 2017). It gives simple statistics based on city and user specified filters (by month, day of the week, both, or no filter). The user will be prompted to select the city followed by how to filter the chosen data. The program then computes:
- popular time of travel
- popular start and end stations
- popular trips
- trip duration
- User Data

The user can then choose to display raw data if desired.

### This Project consists of:
- The main python 3 code: `bikeshare.py`
- Three different city data sets used to analyze*:
  - chicago.csv
  - new_york_city.csv
  - washington.csv

\*These data sets are not available in the commits here. This info is provided only to inform the user that the tool was developed using these data sets, and it may or may not work fully with other data sets.

You will need Python 3.6 to run this program. You can install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
